# Bulk-Assign-Categories-Wordpress
This script bulk assigns categories to wordpress posts based on title of post.

This script was originally created for a coupon site. This coupon site had thousands of posts and needed to assign all these posts to different categories based upon words in the title of the posts. Suppose you have 500 posts with the word "Safeway" in their title and you need to assign all those posts to the safeway category. This program will do it for you.
